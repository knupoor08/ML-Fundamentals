# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Historical data used to teach the model
- **Model**: The learned representation of patterns
- **Prediction**: Output generated by the model on new data

## Common Applications

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics

## Types of ML

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error
